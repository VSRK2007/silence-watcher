Silent Watcher is a stealthy activity tracker built into the Mackadroide Android app using Java.
By pasting a unique link into the phone, the module activates and begins monitoring all ongoing activities in real time.
From app usage and screen interactions to background processes, Silent Watcher provides a comprehensive view of the device's behavior.
It operates silently in the background, making it ideal for remote observation, parental control, or device diagnostics.
The Java-based implementation ensures smooth performance and secure data handling,
giving users deep insight into their device without disrupting normal usage.
